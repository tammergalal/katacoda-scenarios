Congratulations! You're now familiar with Datadog integrations and you know how to install and configure popular core integrations in a container environment. Remember that configuring the Datadog Agent and integrations on a host is the same in principle but would edit YAML files instead. The Datadog Agent configuration documentation covers all environments equally well. See the [integration docs](https://docs.datadoghq.com/integrations/) for more information.

For more information on Datadog integrations, head over to our [Introduction to Integrations Course](https://learn.datadoghq.com/course/view.php?id=38) on the Learning Center.
