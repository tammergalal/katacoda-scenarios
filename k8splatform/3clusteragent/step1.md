In this section you are going to start to work with the Cluster Agent. Remember the Cluster Agent moves much of the job of interrogating the cluster out of the hands of each of the nodes into one or more instances. Since we are using a cluster made of one master node and one worker node, we won't experience much of a performance gain, but in your production systems, you may see a significant improvement. 

1. Let's start by installing the Cluster Agent. As with the previous section, we are using the helm chart, so open the `values.yaml` file in the IDE tab to the right.  
1. Scroll down to line 110 and set **enabled:** to true. 
1. In the video you learned that the cluster agent communicates with the node agents. In order to secure that communication, a token needs to be shared between both configurations. If you want to provide that token, you can do so at line 117, otherwise it is generated and secured automatically. ***Note regarding line numbers:*** *The Helm chart is being updated on a regular basis. The file included in this lab was current during the development of this course but has probably been updated by the time you are taking it. What appears on line 117 in this file is almost certainly not what will appear on line 117 when you download the latest. But the field names are generally the same.*
1. Run helm install to get started. `helm install datadogagent --set datadog.apiKey=$DD_API_KEY --set datadog.appKey=$DD_APP_KEY -f k8s-yaml-files/values.yaml datadog/datadog`{{execute}}
1. Let's look at the pods that are now running. Run `k get pods`{{execute}}.
1. Try running the different status commands for the agent. First `kubectl exec -ti $(kubectl get pods -l app=datadogagent-cluster-agent -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -- agent status`{{execute}}. This gets you the normal agent status.
1. To see the metadata the cluster agent is working with, run `kubectl exec -ti $(kubectl get pods -l app=datadogagent-cluster-agent -o jsonpath='{.items[0].metadata.name}') -- agent metamap`{{execute}}.
1. Navigate to the <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/metric/summary" target="_datadog">Metrics Summary</a> page and search for `cluster_agent`. Notice that you now have access to a number of new metrics. 

There are a number of other features you get with the Cluster Agent that help with applications running on top of your Kubernetes cluster. These will be covered in detail in the Advanced Kubernetes Monitoring course focused on the applications, versus the course that you are in focused on the platform.  

* Horizontal Pod Autoscaler - You can autoscale your pods based on any metric collected. For instance, if the number of requests to your nginx pod increases, add a few pods to handle the load. 
* Cluster Checks - Checks that can be autodiscovered and performed by the cluster agent against Kubernetes control plane services as well as out-of-cluster datastores and endpoints.
* Endpoint Checks - Checks that can be autodiscovered and perfomed to monitor any endpoint behind cluster services.
