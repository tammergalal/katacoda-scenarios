With the [Service List](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/services), we get a high level view of overall service performance. We can quickly see services that are running slower than the rest. When working with a team migrating to microservices, this view can be a great first approach to breaking down existing problems.

For example, if we look at the [Frontend Service](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/service/store-frontend), we can see there are two endpoints in particular that are substantially slower than the rest.

Both the `HomeController#index` and the `ProductController#show` enpoints are showing *much* longer latency times. If we click in and view a trace, we'll see that we've got a downstream microservice taking up a substantial portion of our time.

It seems the `advertisements-service` is taking over 2.5 seconds for each request. Click on the Spans to look at the Tags for the specific url and path group, then we'll check the code to see if we can spot the problem.

The path group is `/ads`. Search through the source code in the file: `ads-service/ads.py`{{open}}

Looking at the code, it appears we've accidentally left a line in from testing what happens if latency goes up. Try spotting the line and removing the code to see if you can bring the latency down again.

Before we restart the services, open the `/deploy/docker-compose/docker-compose-broken-instrumented.yml`{{open}} file and find the `advertisements` settings. Bump the `DD_VERSION` then restart the service using  `ctrl + C`.

Next run:
`POSTGRES_USER=postgres POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres  docker-compose -f docker-compose-broken-instrumented.yml up`{{execute}}

What sort of an improvement in page load time did it give you? Can you graph the differences over time?

**Hint:** We'll want to look at the `/ads` endpoint of the `advertisements-service`.
