![Agent Running](k8s1-install/assets/agent.png)

In this section, you are going to install the Datadog Agent in your environment. To do this we apply a DaemonSet that states that one single Agent should run per node within your cluster. The first step is to set up the various role-based access control permissions needed for the Agent. You will create a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/master/Dockerfiles/manifests/rbac/clusterrole.yaml" target="_datadog">ClusterRole</a>,<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/master/Dockerfiles/manifests/rbac/serviceaccount.yaml" target="_datadog">ServiceAccount</a>, and a <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DataDog/datadog-agent/master/Dockerfiles/manifests/rbac/clusterrolebinding.yaml" target="_datadog">ClusterRoleBinding</a> (you will see the actual commands on the next page, but you should visit these links to see what each role does).


Next, create and apply a manifest for the Agent. In the hands-on exercise, you will see some of the interesting aspects of the manifest.


Once the Agent is deployed, running `kubectl get daemonset` will return information about how many agents are running. Ultimately, you will have the agent running and collecting information about an application including its Postgres database.


Letâ€™s move on to see this in action.
