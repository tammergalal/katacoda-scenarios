Datadogâ€™s Real User Monitoring (RUM) gives you end-to-end visibility into the real-time activity and experience of individual users. It is designed to solve four types of use cases for web and mobile applications:  

1. **Performance:** track the performance of web pages, but also of user actions, network requests, and the performance of your frontend code.

2. **Error Management:** monitor ongoing bugs and issues and track them over time.

3. **Analytics/Usage:** understand who is using your application (i.e., country, device, OS), monitor individual user journeys, and analyze how users interact with your application (e.g., most common page visited, clicks, interactions, feature usage).

4. **Support:** retrieve all of the information related to one user session to troubleshoot an issue (e.g., session duration, pages visited, interactions, resources loaded, errors)

Datadog RUM is supported on multiple platforms, including iOS and Android. This lab focuses on using Datadog RUM in the browser.
