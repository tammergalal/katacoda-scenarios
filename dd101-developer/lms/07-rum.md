# Real User Monitoring

Real User Monitoring (RUM) gives you end-to-end visibility into the real-time activity and experience of individual users.  

RUM collects and visualizes data about actual users who are exercising parts of your software so that you can track real-world performance and behavior of users, web pages, and mobile apps. 

RUM lets you see how your applications and infrastructure respond under real life conditions, from the frontend code to network requests. You can monitor ongoing bugs over time and across versions. It also helps you make product decisions based on real data about user journeys, usage, and interactions instead of on guesses or what people say but donâ€™t really do.

Furthermore, you can provide top-notch support to your users by accessing the actual data related to their problem in their own specific user session. This gives you insight into the actions they took and what results occurred along with related log and APM trace data.

In this lab, you'll become familiar with Datadog RUM by integrating it into an application and seeing what user session data is captured. You will also see what out-of-the-box dashboards are created for you in the Datadog app.
