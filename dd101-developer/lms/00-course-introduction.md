Welcome to **Datadog 101 for Developers**! In this course, you'll learn about many of the core features in Datadog and how it can be used in your environments. 

Datadog is a software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering that specializes in:

* Collecting vast amounts of data that your systems produce
* Putting all of that data in one place
* Organizing that data so it makes sense to you, enabling you and your organization to do your job better

Datadog offers much more than the above list, but everything you do within the service will revolve around those three being in place and working correctly.

Datadog offers a broad range of products, many of which are explored deeply in other Learning Center courses. While a single course can't do them all justice, this course will teach you key parts of the Datadog product that are especially useful to software developers. You'll learn the basics of installing the Datadog Agent, working with integrations, configuring your services for application performance monitoring (APM) and log collection, synthetic API and browser testing, and real user monitoring (RUM).

The goal of this course is to get you up and running with the different services Datadog offers and give you a sense of what's possible. You won't go too deep into any one product, but rather gain a solid foundation in using Datadog. Once you complete this course, you can dive further into what you have learned with more product-specific courses offered at the Datadog Learning Center. 

If you want to take this course in a single sitting, expect to spend a few hours going through it. Some choose to break it up over a few days in a week. You can do whatever works for you, as this course and others on the Datadog Learning Center are available to you 24 hours a day.
