Congratulations on completing **Datadog 101 for Developers**! Hopefully this course has left you feeling comfortable and confident in using Datadog in your day-to-day work. 

In this course, you've learned:

* How the Datadog Agent is installed in a Docker environment and configured with Unified Service Tagging.

* How integrations are used to provide out-of-the-box dashboards, metric collection, and log parsing for different types of application services and programming languages.

* How Application Performance Monitoring (APM) is configured and used to help identify performance issues across services with distributed trace data.

* How log data can be queried, filtered, sorted, and visualized to provide a clearer picture of application performance.

* How synthetic testing can be used to quickly catch a regression in the user experience.

* How to configure and analyze data captured from Real User Monitoring (RUM) to get a fuller picture on user interactions with your application.

While this course covered a lot of material, in reality, you've only scratched the surface of what you can achieve with Datadog. To continue your learning, you're encouraged to take other courses in the Datadog Learning Center that dive further into each topic. Some of these courses may be an extension of what you've learned here while others will introduce you to completely different aspects of Datadog.
