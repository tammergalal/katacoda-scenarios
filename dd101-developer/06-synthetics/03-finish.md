Great job creating Datadog synthetic browser tests to monitor Storedog's discounts service! Now you can rest assured knowing you have a mechanism to detect problems with the discounts service that break the Storedog homepage. In the real world, you would likely go further by:

  - Configuring a notification to alert team members when the test fails
  - Create an API synthetic test to monitor the discounts service directly
  - Create synthetic browser tests to cover important user journeys, such as the entire checkout flow
  - Incorporate synthetic tests into your CI/CD pipeline (see link below)

If you are interested in more information or hands-on time with synthetic tests, head over to our courses [Introduction to Synthetic Tests](https://learn.datadoghq.com/course/view.php?id=39) and [Synthetic Tests in a CI/CD Pipeline](https://learn.datadoghq.com/course/view.php?id=39) on the Learning Center.
