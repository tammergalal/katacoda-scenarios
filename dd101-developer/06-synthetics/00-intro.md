In this part of the course, you'll create a synthetic browser test to ensure an optimal user experience. Browser tests allow you to proactively test on popular user flows and confirm that the Document Object Model (DOM) is in the correct state during a user session.

In this lab, you will:

1. Create a functional test using a synthetic browser test
2. Learn how connect traces to a browser test 

> **Note:** You will use the [Datadog test recorder](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/datadog-test-recorder/kkbncfpddhdmkfmalecgnphegacgejoa?hl=en) Chrome extension to record your tests, so make sure you use Chrome for this activity and install the extension.
