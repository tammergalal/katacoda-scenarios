With the application running and the Datadog agents installed, navigate to [APM > Traces](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/traces). You may need to wait a minute or so for data to show up in Datadog. Once traces begin flowing in, navigate to the [APM > Services](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/services) page and you should see a list of the services that comprise Storedog. In the top right of the page change the timeline to `Past 15 Minutes`, and now click the `advertisements` service. This will bring up a page showing many different aspects of your `advertisements` service including `Total Requests`, `Total Errors`, `Latency` and more. 

Looking at the latency for this service shows a staggering 2.5 second response time! For our customers that is an unacceptable lag. Looking down just below the `Latency Distribution` graph you should see the `Deployments` section. 

![Deployment 1.0](./assets/deployment_tab.png)

Version `1.0` of the `advertisements` service is running and to the far right you will see its very high P95 latency. `P95` refers to the 95th percentile of latency. This means that 95% of your users are experiencing a latency equal to the P95 latency or lower. 

Since we currently only have one version deployed, there is no way to get any kind of deployment comparison data. The latency issue will need to be fixed to see if an improvement can be made over the `1.0` deployment. Thankfully, the engineers have gone ahead and built a new advertisements image, and even provided a new manifest which should *hopefully* fix users latency issues. 

Let's make sure we have updated the version tag to `1.1`.

1. First, copy the new manifest into the `k8s-yaml-files` directory. `cp /root/new-manifests/advertisements_1_1.yaml /root/k8s-yaml-files/advertisements.yaml`{{execute}}

1. Click the `IDE` tab on the right above the terminal and open `/root/k8s-yaml-files/advertisements.yaml`{{open}}

1. On lines 9 and 26 you'll see the engineering team didn't update the version number, so it's `1.0`. We need to update this to `1.1` so that Datadog will recognize this as a new versioned deployment and give us data specific to this deployment. `Version` is one of three Unified Service Tags reserved by Datadog, you can read more about these tags [here](https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/unified_service_tagging/?tab=kubernetes).

1. With our new kubernetes manifest ready, we can now deploy version `1.1` of the `advertisements` service by running the command: `kubectl apply -f k8s-yaml-files/advertisements.yaml`{{execute}}. You should see a new Deployment was created in the terminal output.

1. Next, let's be sure our new deployment is running using `kubectl get deployment -n advertisements-canary`{{execute}}. It may take anywhere from thirty seconds to one minute for the new deployment to show as 'running'. In the end you will see two separate `advertisements` deployments. One with the name `advertisements` and one with the name `advertisements-canary`.

Great! Version `1.1` of the `advertisements` service has been deployed. With the service running, open the [APM > Traces](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/traces) page and on the left-hand menu under `Service` choose `advertisements`. Below that click the `Version` drop down and click `1.1`. Once traces start flowing in, that means you are getting traffic to your newer deployment. Head back over to the [APM > Services > advertisements](https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/service/advertisements) page and after a few minutes you should be able to observe a `1.0` and `1.1` Deployment Version.

**Note**: It may take a few minutes for the new version of the application to show up in the Deployment section of APM > Services.

![Deployment 1.0 and 1.1](./assets/deployments_old_new.png)

Looking at you Deployment panel, you'll see that while the latency is way down but the error rate is quickly rising to a very high percentage of attempted requests! This is not a good result for an attempted fix.

**Note**: If you do not see a version `1.1` deployment, it may take a minute or so to have new traffic hit the `1.1` service and show up in the platform.
