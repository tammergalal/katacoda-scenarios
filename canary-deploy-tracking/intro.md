In this scenario you are going to take an already deployed application and examine with Datadog Deployment Tracking, a feature of Datadog's distributed tracing and APM. You will then create an updated deployment with a canary-like strategy, monitor the change with Datadog Deployment Tracking, and make any necessary fixes to get the new deployment stable and out to the masses. With this canary-like strategy, only a subset of our user-base will ingest our new version deployments, while the rest continue using our stable version. If things go well, we can move them all to stable, and if things go south, we can take down the bad deployment.

<a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/deployment_tracking/">Deployment Tracking</a> uses the reserved `version` tag, one of three <a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/getting_started/tagging/unified_service_tagging/?tab=kubernetes">Unified Service Tags, to allow Datadog to automatically aggregate performance data based on the code version’s infrastructure assets, traces, trace metrics, profiles, and logs. This makes it easy for developers to compare the performance of code deployments against their existing live code to verify that new code is performing properly and that no new errors have surfaced in between versions.
