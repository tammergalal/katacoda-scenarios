<a href="https://docs.datadoghq.com/tracing/deployment_tracking/">Deployment Tracking</a> uses the reserved `version` tag, a unified tag that lets Datadog automatically aggregate performance data based on the code versionâ€™s infrastructure assets, traces, trace metrics, profiles, and logs. This makes it easy for developers to compare the performance of code deployments against their existing live code to verify that new code is performing properly and that no new errors have surfaced in between versions.

In this scenario you are going to take an existing deployment and examine it on with Deployment Tracking, a feature of Datadog distributed tracing and APM. You will then create another deployment with a pseudo Canary strategy, monitor the change with Datadog Deployment Tracking, and make any necessary fixes to get the new deployment stable and out to the masses.
