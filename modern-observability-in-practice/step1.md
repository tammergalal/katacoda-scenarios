Our legacy monolith shop uses Ruby on Rails and Spree. We've started to build out a first set of microservices, and these have been added to an initial set of containers.

We will use `docker-compose` to get our ecommerce application, Storedog, up and running. There's a prebuilt Rails Docker container image, along with the new Python / Flask microservice which will handle our Coupon codes and Ads which display in the store.

In this workshop, we're going to spin up and instrument our application to see where things are broken, and next, find a few bottlenecks.

We'll focus on thinking through what observability might make sense in a real application, and see how setting up observability works in practice.

In the background at the start of this workshop, the repo for our application was cloned from Github. If we change into the directory, we should be able to start the code with the following:

`cd ../ecommworkshop/docker-compose-files`{{execute}}

`POSTGRES_USER=postgres POSTGRES_PASSWORD=postgres  docker-compose -f docker-compose-broken-instrumented.yml up`{{execute}}

Once our images are pulled, we should be able to jump into and view the application within Katacoda. You can either:

1. Click the `storedog` tab on the right to view the application

1. Navigate to [Storedog](https://[[HOST_SUBDOMAIN]]-3000-[[KATACODA_HOST]].environments.katacoda.com/) via URL.

Try browsing around, and notice the homepage takes a very long time to load.

## Spinning up Traffic for Our Site

In our `/ecommworkshop` folder, we've got a copy of [GoReplay](https://goreplay.org).

We've also got a capture of "production" traffic using GoReplay. Let's spin up an infinite loop of that traffic. Click the "+" sign next to the `storedog` tab, and open a new terminal to spin it up:

`cd /ecommworkshop`{{execute}}

`$ ./gor --input-file-loop --input-file requests_0.gor --output-http "http://localhost:3000"`{{execute}}

Once we spin up that traffic, we can then take a look at the issues we've come across since the new team rolled out their first few microservices.

Before being instrumented with Datadog, there'd been reports that the new `advertisements-service` broke the website. With the new deployment on staging, the `frontend` team has blamed the `ads-service` team, and the `advertisements-service` team has blamed the ops team.

With Datadog and APM instrumented in our code, let's see what's really been breaking our application.
