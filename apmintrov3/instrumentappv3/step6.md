The `Advertisements` is a small flask service that can be instrumented much like the `Discounts` service. Go ahead and setup that instrumentation for a full view into the applications performance.

## Advertisements yml changes

1. Click `docker-compose.yml`{{open}}. If you look at **line 73**, you'll see:

    ```
    flask run --port=5002 --host=0.0.0.0
    ```

    The `ddtrace` Python library includes an executable that allows you to automatically instrument our Python application. You simply call the `ddtrace-run` application, followed by our normal deployment, and magically, everything is instrumented.

2. Click **Copy to Editor** below or manually copy and paste the text where indicated to add the `ddtrace-run` wrapper to the command that brings up the Flask server. Note that the port for this service is 5002. 

    <pre class="file" data-filename="docker-compose.yml" data-target="insert" data-marker="command: flask run --port=5002 --host=0.0.0.0">
command: ddtrace-run flask run --port=5002 --host=0.0.0.0</pre> 

With this, you're now ready to *configure* our application's instrumentation.

Automatic instrumentation is done via environment variables in our docker yml files starting on **line 82**:

3. Click **Copy to Editor** below or manually copy and paste the text where indicated to add the following to the list of environment variables for the service. 

    <pre class="file" data-filename="docker-compose.yml" data-target="insert" data-marker="# add ads env variables">
         - DATADOG_SERVICE=advertisements-service
         - DD_ENV=intro-apm
         - DD_VERSION=1.0
         - DD_LOGS_INJECTION=true
         - DD_TRACE_SAMPLE_RATE=1
         - DD_PROFILING_ENABLED=true
         - DD_AGENT_HOST=agent</pre>

4. Click **Copy to Editor** below or manually copy and paste the text where indicated to add labels to enable logs. 

    <pre class="file" data-filename="docker-compose.yml" data-target="insert" data-marker="# add ads log labels">
       labels:
         com.datadoghq.ad.logs: '[{"source": "python", "service": "advertisements-service"}]'</pre>

5. Click `docker-compose down && docker-compose up -d`{{execute}} to restart the docker deployment to apply these changes. <p> The **advertisements** section of the docker-compose file should now look like the screenshot below. <p> ![instrumented-adverstisements](instrumentapp2/assets/instrumented-advertisements.png)

6. Navigate to <a href="https://app.datadoghq.com/apm/traces" target="_datadog">**APM > Traces** </a> in Datadog to view the list of traces that are coming in. <p> You should now see traces for the `advertisements` service in the list. This may take a couple of minutes.

7. Click a trace for the `advertisements` service to view the Flame Graph, Span List, Tags, related Hosts, and related Logs.

With these steps, the Python-based services are also instrumented for APM with Datadog. The final list for **Service** under **Facets** is shown below.

The `postgres` service appears in the list because it is installed and automatically instrumented to support the discounts and advertisements services using **Line 12** in their `requirements.txt`{{open}} for both services. You can view <a href="https://ddtrace.readthedocs.io/en/stable/integrations.html#module-ddtrace.contrib.psycopg" target="_blank"> Datadog's Python tracing client</a> for more details.
